Imagine a world where your code isn't just a single, monolithic entity, but a team of intelligent, collaborative agents working together to solve problems more efficiently and effectively. This isn't science fiction – it's the power of multi-agent systems (MAS), and it's poised to revolutionize how software developers build the future.\n",

            "*   **Specialization and Expertise:** Each agent can be designed with specific skills and knowledge, much like a specialized team member. This leads to more optimized and robust solutions for particular sub-problems.\n",
            "*   **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** If one agent fails, others can often pick up the slack or adapt their behavior, making the overall system more resilient to errors and failures.\n",

            "*   **Flesh out Elias's character and motivation:** While his thrumming heart indicates excitement, we don't yet know *why* this map captivates him so deeply. Is it a yearning for adventure after years of routine? A hint of a past he’s tried to forget? Adding a brief internal thought or memory connected to the map could make his reaction more resonant.\n",
            "*   **Enhance the sensory details of the map:** You've described the vellum and the glowing symbols. Could you add more? Perhaps the map smells of something unusual, or the symbols make a faint sound, or the \"light\" has a specific color or temperature? These details would make the discovery even more immersive.\n",
            "*   **Hint at the stakes or potential consequences:** The \"X\" marks a spot in \"inky blackness.\" Is this a place of danger, or great reward? Briefly suggesting what the 'X' *might* represent, or the potential challenges in reaching it, would immediately raise the stakes and draw the reader further into the mystery.\n",
            "RefinerAgent > Elias traced the salt-crusted lines on the worn table, the familiar scent of brine and damp wood doing little to soothe him. Another storm rolled in, the lighthouse beam cutting a frantic swathe through the churning sea, each sweep a testament to the thirty years he’d served as keeper. He’d seen every kind of flotsam the ocean disgorged, from splintered masts to whispered warnings from drowned sailors. But this… this was different.\n",

            "He’d found it tangled in a fishing net that morning, a roll of what felt like vellum, strangely smooth and cool to the touch, emitting a faint scent of ozone and something else… something like forgotten spices. Unfurled, it revealed a map, but not of any coast he knew. Symbols pulsed with a faint, emerald light, shifting like phosphorescence in the deep, and they hummed with a barely audible frequency that resonated in his teeth. A single, bold ‘X’ marked a spot far out into the inky blackness, a place that whispered of both untold riches and ancient perils. His heart, usually as steady as the lighthouse’s rhythm, began to thrum a wild, unbidden beat. Thirty years of predictable tides had dulled something within him, a yearning for the unknown that this map, smelling of distant shores and danger, had just ignited. This wasn't just flotsam; it was a call to a life beyond the comforting, monotonous beam.\n",
